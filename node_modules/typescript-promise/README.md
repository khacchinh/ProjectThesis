# typescript-promise

A simple, small promise library written in Typescript with some extra tricks up it's sleeve.

* Based on [Zousan](https://github.com/bluejava/zousan)
* Under 800 bytes gzipped
* Supports unlimited arguments passing through the promises.
* Full typings
* Mostly A+ Compliant

## Usage

This lib exposes the `TSPromise` variable, use it just as you would `Promise`

```Typescript
import { TSPromise } from "typescript-promise";

new TSPromise((res, rej) => {
    res(1, 2, 3);
}).then((arg1, arg2, arg) => {
    console.log(arg1, arg2, arg3) // <= 1,2,3
});

```
